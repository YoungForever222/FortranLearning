## About the Author
STEPHEN J. CHAPMAN received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Louisiana State University (1975), an M.S.E. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Central Florida (1979), and pursued further graduate studies at Rice University.

From 1975 to 1980, he served as an officer in the U.S. Navy, assigned to teach Electrical Engineering at the U.S. Naval Nuclear Power School in Orlando, Florida. From 1980 to 1982, he was affiliated with the University of Houston, where he ran the power systems program in the College of Technology.

From 1982 to 1988 and from 1991 to 1995, he served as a Member of the Technical Staff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technologyâ€™s Lincoln Laboratory, both at the main facility in Lexington, Massachusetts, and at the field site on Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. While there, he did research in radar signal processing systems. He ultimately became the leader of four large operational range instrumentation radars at the Kwajalein field site (TRADEX, ALTAIR, ALCOR, and MMW).

From 1988 to 1991, Mr. Chapman was a research engineer in Shell Development Company in Houston, Texas, where he did seismic signal processing research. He was also affiliated with the University of Houston, where he continued to teach on a part-time basis.

Mr. Chapman is currently Manager of Systems Modeling and Operational Analysis for BAE Systems Australia, in Melbourne, Australia. He is the leader of a team that has developed a model of how naval ships defend themselves against antiship missile attacks. This model contains more than 400,000 lines of MATLAB code written over more than a decade, so he has extensive practical experience applying MATLAB to real-world problems.

Mr. Chapman is a Senior Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (and several of its component societies). He is also a member of the Association for Computing Machinery and the Institution of Engineers (Australia).
